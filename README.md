Swarm - A Distributed Programming Language
==========================================

This is prototype code written in Scala for a distributed programming language (provisionally) called "Swarm".  This is for experimentation only, especially to determine how Swarm might scale in practice, and to experiment with various data partitioning strategies.  Any actual effort to make Swarm a reality would undoubtedly not begin with this codebase.
